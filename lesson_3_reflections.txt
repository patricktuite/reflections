When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When working from multiple computers or with a team on a single project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Often you would be working with other people collaboratively on GitHub
    and any changes may not reflect what you want your local code to look like.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is a GitHub only clone or copy of a repository that references back
    to the original repository automatically. A clone is an exact copy of a
    repository that can be taken from anywhere. A clone does not allow you to
    contribute back to the original repo so you would want to fork if you plan
    on making changes and getting them back to the original owner. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
